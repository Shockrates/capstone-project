** <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
TThis is an accompanying document for the solution of the typescript seminar’s capstone-project. Following this paragraph there are instructions on how to run the project in your local machine. Some information about the server is provided after that. You may skip to the ANGULAR-CLIENT section of the file for more information about the project 

** <h2>HOW TO RUN</h2>
Clone or download the project from GitHub.
Open a command line and cd to the “server” folder root directory and run “npm install”
To run the server run “npm start” 
Open another command line and cd to the “project-client” folder (this is the Angular application).
Run npm install and Ng serve.

<h2> SERVER SETUP</H2>

The server is a simple custom server built with Node.js and Express for the needs of the project. The server connects to an Atlas MongoDb cloud database populated with some test data.

You can change the database connection to a different Atlas db by editing the “USER”, “PASSWORD” and “DB” fields in the “config/config.ts” file
If you wish to use another Mongo DB you may edit the “uri” field in the “server.ts” file.
The server has the following structure:

●	Config:
	Config.ts: Sets the environmental values of the app    
	logging.ts: Implements some methods for logging information   	   
●	Types: Implements the interface for the employee and and device    
●	Models: Sets a schema for employee and device and creates the models   
●	Routes: Implements the router for employee and device   
●	Controllers: Implements the CRUD methods for employee and device.    
●	Server: The entry point of the app    

The server exposes the following API. 

**Note**: The “id” is the id generated by Mongo DB

**Note 2**: The GET/employe-device/{id} will return a response containing the details of the requested object assigned devices-employees. All other calls will only contain the ids of the assign objects in the response.


Employees | Devices
------------ | -------------
• GET /employee  | • GET /device
• GET /employee/{id} |• GET /device/{id}
• POST /employee | • POST /device
• PUT /employee/{id} | • PUT /device/{id}
• DELETE /employee/{id} | • DELETE /device/{id}

<h2>ANGULAR CLIENT</h2>

In this section I will try to describe, in summary, the structure and functionality of the Angular application. Following this section there is a description of the structure of the app and some notable omissions. Please take note that in a real world application some of the functionality would be implemented in the back-end, as such, some of it was either omitted or implemented in a way to show the use of Angular. Notably:  
●	Generation unique Ids for Employees would be built-in on the server. Manually entering it is required in the app.  
●	Validation of unique fields would happen in the backend and it would send back an invalid response, although this could be simulated in Angular by retrieving all the unique fields from the database and comparing them to the user’s passed value, as of the writing of this document it hasn’t been implemented yet.   
●	Assigning a device to an employee would be made easier with a single API call (in the form of PUT /employee/{id}/assign/{deviceId} or similar) and let the server handle the assignment.   


<h2>Notes about unit testing</h2>
Unfortunately, due to time constraints unit testing was added to the bare minimum (making sure that the auto generated tests would succeed by handling imports and adding some tests to see if some html elements are created). Although more tests will be added if time allows as of the writing of this document this is the only implementation of unit testing

<h2>Structure</h2>

<h2>Classes</h2>

The *Employee.ts* and *Device.ts* files contain the structure of employee and device model respectively. They are stored in the”models” folder.
Beside the required fields provided in the project description the following fields have been added. 
An “_id” field for storing the object’s _id given by Mongo Db.
A “device” table field of type “any” to Employee class  for storing the employee’s assigned devices.
An “employeeId” field of type “any” to the Device for storing the Employee in who the device has been assigned

<h2>Services</h2>
The *Employee.service.ts* and *Device.service.ts* files contain the methods for communicating with the back-end. They are stored in the”services” folder.

<h2>Components</h2>

**Note**: In general both employee and device components implement similar functions so they have similar structure and methods so I won’t go into details about device component since all the methods in device are present in the employee.

*Employee Component*  
●	Is the entry page of the application  
●	Creates the dashboard for our employees.   
●	Uses button html elements to switch visibility between its child components (by passing a “toggle” variable).  
●	Implements the “get all employees”, “get employee by id” adn “delete employee” functionality.  
●	Allows navigation to Assign Component and passing an eEmployee to it through a router link  
●	ChildComponents: EmployeeDetails and EmployeeForm  

*EmployeeDetails Component*    
●	Creates a boostrap card that shows details of a single user passed by parent  
●	Used as child of Employee and Assign component    

*EmployeeForm Component*      
●	Creates a reactive form for updating an employee or creating a new one    
●	Functionality changes through the use of “toggle” variable passed by parent  
●	Implements the “update employee” and “create new employee” functionality.  
●	When the form is used to update, the form fields are populated using an Employee object passed by parent. ReadOnly input fields for the assigned devices are also been generated    
●	Emmits any changes to the parent component.  
●	Is used both as a child o Employee Component and as its own page when used to create an employee  

*Assign Component*    
●	Shows the details of the selected Employee (through the EmployeeDetails component) along with assigned devices to the Employee a list and a list of the available devices  
●	The devices names are clickable clicking on an unassigned device will assign it to the current employee and vice versa  
●	Assigning a device to an employee makes two API update calls to the backend, one for the device and one for the user.  
●	Changes are also reflected to the DOM  
●	Used for handling a single Employee (you can navigate her by selecting the Assign Button on the Employees dashboard)  

*AssignPage Component*      
●	Parent of the Assign Component. Adds a list of Employees which the user may select to assign devices.     
●	Used for handling multiple Employees   
●	You can navigate here from the nav-bar  

*Header Component*  
●	A simple navigation bar used for navigation between the dashboard, forms and assign pages
